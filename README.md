# hTimer
basically it just a timer that can be run at the background and nothing special about it. some special it just an aesthetic background that i stole from internet and i don't know who's made it, but like i say it just a timer for you to focus at work. at first i want to make it pomodoro timer but i think this just more like a desktop timer app

## how to install
1. clone this repos
2. run `npm init`
3. if you don't have rust then install rust to your machine
4. run `npm run dev`

## Documentation
